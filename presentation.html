# Controlling GPIO with Scala
---
class: middle

## A GPIO output pin is set digitally

```scala
sealed trait PinState
case object High extends PinState
case object Low extends PinState
```

There are 2 possible states:
* High (outputting 5V of power)
* Low (not outputting any power)
---
class: middle

```scala
trait DigitalOutput {
  def enterState(state: PinState): Task[Unit]
}
```
Each motor is a `DigitalOutput`: it has a function that:
* Given a desired `PinState` (`High` or `Low`)
* Will give you back an asynchronous container
  * When run, it will have a side-effect of causing the GPIO pin to become high or low

```scala
case class PiDigitalOutput(pin: GpioPinDigitalOutput) extends DigitalOutput {

  override def enterState(state: PinState): Task[Unit] = Task {
    state match {
      case High => pin.high()
      case Low => pin.low()
    }
  }

}
```
---
class: middle

## 2 digital outputs control Bob's movement

```scala
trait Controller {
  val leftMotor: DigitalOutput
  val rightMotor: DigitalOutput
}
```


```scala
case class PiController(controller: GpioController) extends Controller {

  val leftMotor = PiDigitalOutput(controller.provisionDigitalOutputPin(
    RaspiPin.GPIO_07,
    PinState.LOW))

  val rightMotor = PiDigitalOutput(controller.provisionDigitalOutputPin(
    RaspiPin.GPIO_01,
    PinState.LOW))

}
```
---
class: middle
### How do we use the `Controller` to make Bob do things?

```scala
class Action(leftMotorState: PinState, rightMotorState: PinState)
  extends ((Controller) => Task[Unit]) {

  def apply(controller: Controller): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- controller.leftMotor enterState leftMotorState
      _ <- controller.rightMotor enterState rightMotorState
    } yield ()

}
```
```scala
  case object Forward extends Action(High, High)
  case object Left extends Action(Low, High)
  case object Right extends Action(High, Low)
  case object Halt extends Action(Low, Low)
```
---
class: middle

## To run an action against a controller

```scala
def interpret(controller: Controller)(action: Action): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- Task { println(action) }
      _ <- action(controller)
    } yield ()
```

# Scalaz-Stream

{{content}}
---
template: scalazstream

## A streaming I/O library for Scala
---
template: scalazstream

## But why?
---
template: scalazstream

## I wanted an excuse to play around with it
---
template: scalazstream

## It'll be replaced by a library called FS2 soon
---
template: scalazstream

## Because some people fell out in a chatroom
---
template: scalazstream

## But the concept will still be the same
---
# scalaz.stream.Process
* A `Process` represents a (possibly infinite) stream of data of a fixed type

--
* Data will be pulled from some `Source`

--
* The data can be sliced and diced in the usual manners (`filter`, `map`, etc.)

--
* Some data can then arrive at a `Sink`
  * Something that consumes data
  * E.g. a database... or a motor controller

--
* Effects, such as asynchronicity, may be encountered along the way
---
class: middle
# Declaring a `Process`

```scala
Process[+F[_], A]
```
where:
* `F[_]` is the side effect container type encounted when building by the `Process`
  * Often `Task` or `Nothing`
* `A` is the type of the data that flows through the `Process`
---
class: middle
# Making a Source
```scala
  def readLine: Task[String] = Task { Console.readLine() }
```
```scala
  val oneName: Process[Task, String] = Process eval readLine
```
```scala
  val manyNames: Process[Task, String] = Process repeatEval readLine
```
---
class: middle
# Making a Sink
```scala
type Sink[+F[_], A] = Process[F, A => F[Unit]]
```
Looks complex but:
```scala
def sendEmail(address: String): Task[Unit] = Task { println(s"this is an email to $address") }
val emailSink: Sink[Task, String] = Process repeatEval Task(sendEmail _)
```
---
class: middle
```scala
def interpret(controller: Controller)(action: Action): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- Task { println(action) }
      _ <- action(controller)
    } yield ()
```
### How do we turn `interpret` into a `Sink`?
```scala
// type Sink[+F[_], A] = Process[F, A => F[Unit]]

val interpreter: Sink[Task, Action] =
  Process repeatEval Task(interpret(controller)_)
```
---
class: middle
## How do we declare a `Source` of `Action`?
```scala
val actions = async.boundedQueue[Action](10)
```
This is an in-memory bounded typed queue.<br/>
We can easily turn it into a source:
```scala
val actionReader: Process[Task, Action] = actions.dequeue
```
---
class: middle
### Putting it all together

```scala
def interpret(controller: Controller)(action: Action): Task[Unit] =
    for {
      _ <- Task { println(action) }
      _ <- action(controller)
    } yield ()
```

```scala
val actions = async.boundedQueue[Action](10)

val interpreter: Sink[Task, Action] =
  Process repeatEval Task(interpret(controller)_)
val actionSource: Process[Task, Action] = actions.dequeue
```

```scala
(actionSource to interpreter).run.run
```
Whenever some data is added to the `actions` queue, it will pass through to the `interpreter` Sink: Bob will move
---
class: middle, center

## But how do we get data onto the `actions`  queue?
--

### Bob does it by accepting HTTP POST requests
---
class: middle

## http4s is a HTTP library built on top of Scalaz-Stream

```scala
  def processActionRequest(action: Action): Task[Response] =
      actions.enqueueOne(action).flatMap(_ => Ok())

  val bobRoute = HttpService {

    case POST -> Root / "left" => processActionRequest(Left)

    case POST -> Root / "right" => processActionRequest(Right)

    case POST -> Root / "forward" => processActionRequest(Forward)

    case POST -> Root / "halt" => processActionRequest(Halt)

  }
```

You produce a `HttpService` by providing a `PartialFunction[Request, Task[Response]]`

---
class: middle

## We can then start a HTTP server:

```scala
val bobServer: Process[Task, Server] = Process eval (BlazeBuilder.bindHttp(8080, "0.0.0.0")
    .mountService(bobRoute, "/api")
    .start)
```
---
class: middle
## We now have 2 `Process` instances
* One `Process` reads an `Action` from an in-memory queue, and set appropriate GPIO state
* One `Process` receives HTTP POST requests, and adds an appropriate `Action` to the in-memory queue
---
class: middle
## What would happen if we ran them both?

```scala
val bobBrain = (actionSource to interpreter)
val bobServer: Process[Task, Server] = Process eval (BlazeBuilder.bindHttp(8080, "0.0.0.0")
    .mountService(bobRoute, "/api")
    .start)
```
```scala
bobBrain.run.run
bobServer.run.run
```
--

`bobBrain` is an infinite stream, `bobServer` will never get the chance to run!
---
class: middle

### By default, things flow through a `Process` sequentially
#### If you want to run many `Process` instances in parallel, you need to explicitly merge them
--

```scala
(bobBrain merge bobServer).run.run
```
---
class: middle

## Scalaz-Stream has given us a nice, clean way of dealing with data flows
### Not much boilerplate was needed
---
class: middle, center
# This makes testing really natural
---
class: middle

# A stub `Controller`:

```scala
case class StubController() extends Controller {

  var leftMotorSignals: Seq[State] = Seq.empty
  var rightMotorSignals: Seq[State] = Seq.empty

  override val leftMotor: DigitalOutput = new DigitalOutput {
    override def enterState(state: State): Task[Unit] =
      Task { leftMotorSignals = leftMotorSignals :+ state }
  }

  override val rightMotor: DigitalOutput = new DigitalOutput {
    override def enterState(state: State): Task[Unit] =
      Task { rightMotorSignals = rightMotorSignals :+ state }
  }

}
```
---
class: middle

## A Process doesn't care where data initially comes from:

```scala
test("Bob can interpret a single Forward command") {
    val controller = RaspberryPi.StubController()
    val bob = BobMain.bob(controller)

    val actions: Process[Task, Action] = Process(Forward, Halt)

    (actions to bob).run.run

    withClue("left motor signals") { controller.leftMotorSignals shouldBe Seq(High, Low) }
    withClue("right motor signals") { controller.rightMotorSignals shouldBe Seq(High, Low) }
}
```

# Thanks!
That's all from me. I hope I have:
* Inspired you to play around with Raspberry Pi's
* Given a brief introduction to Scalaz-Stream
  * Shown you why it's quite a nice model
